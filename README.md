HumanMadeArtisanalCode

This is a repository of code that is written by humans, or written by AI to look like it was written by humans. We believe that software engineering can be as much art as science, and we celebrate the creative and humorous side of programming.

In this repository, you'll find examples of code that range from the quirky to the absurd. We hope you enjoy them as much as we enjoyed writing them!

Examples

Here are some of the examples of human-written artisanal code that you can find in this repository:

Fortran: A 16-tap complex LMS equalizer written by a fictitious engineer at Bell Labs. Includes humorous comments and pithy observations.
Python: Beamforming on two antennas from a wireless research company in the early 2000s. The comments include some witty observations about linear algebra.
C++: A sorting algorithm that uses the Fibonacci sequence to determine the gap size. The comments are full of Fibonacci jokes and puns.
Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds to this repository. If you have a code example that you think is particularly funny or quirky, please feel free to submit a pull request. Just make sure that your code is well-documented and follows good programming practices, even if it's meant to be humorous!

And remember, the goal of this repository is to celebrate the creative and humorous side of programming. So don't be afraid to let your imagination run wild!
